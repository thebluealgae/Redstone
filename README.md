# Hi there
I attempt uploading my personal redstone worlds so you can visit and download my worlds. For my own preferences, you must run the lastest Minecraft version on your computer if you want to play my world, or errors will occur on your game or world. So DO NOT feedback to me the errors that are caused by being opened by an incorrect Minecraft version!

Nowadays some redstone equipments are being complete and I am also learning more "Redstone Curcits" knowledge from everywhere. I dreamed of being a redstone-calculator builder and my plans of this "calculator" will be designed in few days.

# 请看这里
我试着把我的红石存档发到这里，这样就可以访问并下载我的存档。由于我的个人习惯，如果你想游玩我的存档，你必须得用最新版本的MC打开才行。不然，你的游戏或这个存档将会遇到错误。所以，别让我看到因用错误的版本打开而导致的错误的反馈！

现今我正在完善这些红石元件，我也在从各个地方学习有关“红石电路”的知识。我想成为一位“红石计算器”制作人，而有关这个计算器的计划会在几天后传到这里。
