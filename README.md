# Hi there
I attempt uploading my personal redstone worlds so you can visit and download my worlds. For my own habits, you must run the lastest Minecraft version on your computer, or errors will occur on your game or world. So DO NOT feedback to me the errors that are caused by being opened by an incorrect Minecraft version!

Nowadays some redstone equipments are being complete and I am also learning more "Redstone Curcits" knowledge from everywhere. I dreamed of being a redstone-calculator builder and my plans of this "calculator" will be designed in few days.
